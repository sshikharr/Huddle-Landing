## Overview

In this project I have built a landing page for a website named Huddle. I have used HTML and CSS to create this project, this was a beginners level project and gave me hands-on experience on how to use Basic HTML and CSS.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
